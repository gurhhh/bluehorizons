								<h3 class="text-center">Blue Horizons: The
								Voyage of the Nkhwazi</h3>

								<p>'The Voyage of the Nkhwazi' is the second
								expedition undertaken by Jack and Angus. They
								travelled to Lake Malawi, first revealed to
								European eyes in 1846 and later explored by
								David Livingstone in 1859, the 3rd largest lake
								in Africa. They commissioned the construction
								of a local wooden fishing boat - the HMS
								Nkhwazi and planned to navigate the entirety of
								the lake. They set course to travel from the
								southern tip of the Lake to the northern Coast
								along the isolated east coast. Local knowledge
								was key to the success of the expedition so
								they enlisted the help of Charles Gilson, a
								Malawian who could speak Chichewe, Yao and
								English (the former two being spoken along much
								of the eastern coast). The hardship of the trip
								as well as the proximity of either working
								alongside each other on the boat or sleeping
								together in a tent meant that a firm friendship
								sprung up between Charles and the boys. HMS
								Nkhwazi (Chichewe for Eagle) was propelled by
								10 hour days of rowing on oars with rope
								bindings acting in lieu of rollicks. However,
								when the wind was blowing in the right
								direction (which was disappointingly
								infrequent) they were able to indeed fly like
								an Nkhwazi as they fashioned a sail from
								potatoe sack cloth and a mast from a tree
								trunk.</p>

								<p>The Lake proved a tough adversary as the
								trio of boys battled storms and 10ft waves as
								their small vessel braved the elements. The
								adventure also suffered from a chronic lack of
								food as settlements were so few and far between
								and the villages they did come across often
								didn’t have the resources to furnish the boys
								with provisions. This meant that one meal a day
								of rice and chomba (a type of fish of the lake)
								and the odd chapatti for a snack was the only
								sustenance available for the gruelling days of
								exertion. Yet the real aim of the trip was to
								understand and document the lives of the local
								fishermen of the lake. Often operating out of
								dugout canoes, or out of larger boats at night
								with kerosene lamps to help attract fish, these
								men of the lake eke out an incredibly hard
								existence: theirs is a world on the edge of
								humanity’s frontiers with nature. Alongside
								these rugged lifestyles was the lake – truly
								magnificent in its beauty. Often the water was
								so clear the boys could see to a depth of 30
								metres down. The lake was framed by the
								magnificent Livingstone Mountains rising
								straight up out of the lake and at dusk the
								huge mass of water would often transform into
								an inky mirror reflecting the oranges pinks,
								blues and yellows that only an African sky can
								give.</p>

								<p>But all was not always tranquil in paradise,
								on the Tanzanian border Angus, Jack and Charles
								were woken up in the middle of the night
								surrounded by villagers and some men wielding
								rifles. The locals had called in the police
								fearful that this boat landing with two English
								boys and a Malawian was something to do with
								the oil dispute between Malawi and Tanzania.
								Luckily the situation was quickly diffused.
								Perseverance and determination saw the boys to
								the top of the lake. The adventure was again
								filmed and is currently in the post production
								stage.</p>
