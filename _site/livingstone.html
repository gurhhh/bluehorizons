						<p>In November 2014 Jack Wrigley and Angus Aitken plan to recreate Dr David Livingstone’s trans African trek on the 160th anniversary of the original expedition. They will set out from Luanda in Angola in early November and reach Quelimane in Mozambique seven months later. The total distance is approximately 5000km. The expedition will be conducted entirely by means which would have been available to Livingstone – by animal, on foot and by dug out canoe.</p>
 
<p>A three part documentary series will be made recording the adventure as well as the legacy which Livingstone and his ideas have left on the area he explored. Jack and Angus will also seek to raise £60,000 shared equally between three charities addressing the contemporary problems these regions now face. They will follow Livingstone’s original route as closely as possible. However, small deviations for minefields and other known dangers will have to be made.</p>
 
<p>Livingstone had come to Luanda from Makololo to find a route for legitimate commerce to the Atlantic which could undercut the slave trade.  However, he was unsatisfied with the route he had marked out to the West Coast. So on the 20th of September 1854 he began retracing his steps back into the interior in order to take his Makololo followers home and to conduct further research on the Zambezi river. He hoped the river would act as a navigable highway from the interior of Africa to the Indian Ocean. He reached Quelimane in Mozambique on May 25th 1856. He was the first European to make such a crossing from one side of the continent to the other and was lionized by the British press as well as the world beyond.</p>
 
<p>The trek will take them through an astonishing breadth of landscapes and different cultures. They will pass through deserts, jungle, urban metropolises and isolated tribal villages.</p>
