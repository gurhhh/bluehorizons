								<h3 class="text-center">Blue Horizons: A Journey with Nomads</h3>

								<p>In 2011 Jack Wrigley and Angus Aitken – two friends since school days – set out on an ambitious expedition to cross Mongolia travelling and living with nomads. The premise was simple: they wanted to discover a land with the help of those who had been wandering it for generations. Their journey started in the far north of Mongolia in the Shishged Depression, home to the infamous Darhad Black Shamans and headed south on horseback with two guides Davaa and Erdenejii and six horses; their goal being to reach Dalanzadgad in the heart of the Gobi Desert. They sought to capture and record the nomads’ way of life which in many ways would have been recognisable from the days of Genghis Khan. What they found was a very special and tough people – resourceful, resilient, and fiercely proud of their traditional ways. They crossed Mongolia’s vast and varied landscape including the Khangai Nuruu Mountain range after which the boys decided to climb the 4000m Ikh Bog Uul – the highest mountain in the Gobi. It was here that their expedition was almost stopped dead in its tracks. Misjudging the height of the peak the boys were forced to spend a night out in the open with nothing but light clothing and each others body warmth as they huddled together to avoid hypothermia. However the mountain also afforded another special friendship as the boys chanced upon Tuvshinbat, a goat herder and hunter who spent stretches of time in a Ger close to the peak. After marmot hunting and living with this very special mountain man the boys descended from Ikh Bogd Uul. They bought a camel – whom they named after a former teacher on account of its character and demeanour – and proceeded into the Gobi Desert. Battling temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius and heat exhaustion the boys had to race from water source to water source at one stage having to cover 150km in 3 days lest they run out of water. After 48 days of living with, learning from and travelling besides nomads they reached their destination of Dalanzadgad. Their 1000 mile adventure was filmed and edited into a documentary ‘Blue Horizons: A Journey with Nomads’ which was screened in the autumn of 2013.</p>
